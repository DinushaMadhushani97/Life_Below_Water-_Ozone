# Life_Below_Water-_Ozone
This is my 3rd Year 2nd Semester Project under the ITPM(Information Technology Project Management). This is an Group Assignment related Project. In here we created this project under the one category of SDG problems.

🌊🐋🚰 **Project "Ozone": Protecting Life Below Water 🌊🐋🚰**

Under the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), we have chosen the noble cause of "Life Below Water." Our purpose is to address and reduce various challenges related to water that affect both people and the environment. Through our project, we aim to protect threatened animals, minimize water-related problems for communities, and combat water pollution.

🌟 **Our Mission**

Our mission is to develop the "Ozone" web application, a powerful tool designed to assist people in overcoming water-related issues and safeguarding the natural world from threats. With a focus on helping threatened animals and ecosystems, we aim to create a positive impact on both human lives and the environment.

🚀 **Empowering Communities**

"Ozone" offers several essential features to tackle water-related challenges faced by communities worldwide:

💧 **Water Delivery Management:** We provide an efficient system to ensure access to clean and safe water, addressing the concerns of those living in areas struggling with unclean water or scarcity.

🤝 **Donation Management:** Our application enables users to support initiatives aimed at improving water quality and aiding communities in need. Through transparent donation management, we encourage collective efforts for positive change.

🐾 **Threatened Animal List Management:** By identifying and tracking threatened animal species, we strive to create awareness and support conservation efforts for these vulnerable creatures. Together, we can protect their habitats and ensure their survival for future generations.

🌱 **Cleanup Program Management:** With a focus on combating water pollution, we provide a platform for organizing and managing cleanup initiatives. By mobilizing communities, we can actively reduce pollution and preserve the health of aquatic ecosystems.

🌍 **Towards a Sustainable Future**

With "Ozone," we are committed to promoting sustainable practices and fostering a sense of responsibility towards our planet. By collaborating with individuals, organizations, and governments, we envision a world where all communities have access to clean water, and threatened animals thrive in their natural habitats.
